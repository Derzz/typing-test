This is a simple typing test made with ReactJs, it determines the user's WPM based on how many characters are inputted after how long the user typed for. The quotes are chosen from various games such as Doom Eternal, Half Life, Fallout New Vegas, and Fallout 3. 



This application uses various functional and class components from React and utilizes the Effect and State hooks. 



## WPM Calculations

WPM is calculated with the below formula with equation mentioned [here]([WPM Calculator - TypingTyping](https://www.typingtyping.com/wpm-calculator/)). The calculator using the following formula below:



$$
\text{Gross WPM} = \frac{\frac{\text{Number of Characters User Typed}}{5}}{\text{Time in Minutes}}
$$




This makes it fair so there is a clear difference in WPM when the user types the word 'house' and 'Honorificabilitudinitatibus'.
